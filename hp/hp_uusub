<info>
There exists a buffer overflow vulnerability in the command line parsing code 
portion of the uusub program. This bug can be triggered by invoking uusub
program with a long string argument passed with -a command line option. When
appropriately exploited it can lead to the privilege elevation attack as user
id of uucp can be gained on a vulnerable system.
