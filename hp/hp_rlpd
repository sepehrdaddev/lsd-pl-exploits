<info>
There exists a vulnerability in the rlpdaemon printer daemon. The vulnerability
is caused by improper handling of the filenames by this service. When
appropriately exploited it can lead to remote file creation on a vulnerable
system (files can be created with the privileges of the lp user and with 
arbitrary content).
