<info>
There exists a buffer overflow vulnerability in the command line parsing code
portion of the pcltotiff. This bug can be triggered by invoking pcltotiff
program with a long string argument passed with -t command line option. During
program execution, this argument is further insecurely copied into the stack
buffer with the use of strcpy() function and without any size checking. When 
appropriately exploited this bug can lead to privilege elevation as group id
of bin can be gained on a vulnerable system.
