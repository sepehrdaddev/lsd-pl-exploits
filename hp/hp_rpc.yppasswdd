<info>
There exists a  a buffer overflow vulnerability in the rpc.yppasswdd service.
It can be triggered by sending carefully crafted string argument to the
YPPASSWDPROC_UPDATE function. In function changepasswd() the pw_name field of
the passwd structure is copied to a fixed buffer  with the use of strcpy()
function call. As this call is done without any checking of the string length
and boundaries,program stack can be overwritten in a result of a buffer overflow
condition. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited to gain unauthorised 
access to the target HP-UX system with administrative (root user) privileges.
