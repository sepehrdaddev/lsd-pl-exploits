<info>
There exists a buffer overflow vulnerability in the command line parsing code 
portion of the stmkfont program. This bug can be triggered by invoking stmkfont
program with a long string argument. When appropriately exploited it can lead
to privilege elevation attack as group id of bin can be gained on a vulnerable
system.
