<info>
There exists a buffer overflow vulnerability in the command line parsing code 
portion of the uucp program. This bug can be triggered by invoking uucp
program with a long string argument. When appropriately exploited it can lead
to privilege elevation attack as group id of uucp can be gained on a vulnerable
system.
