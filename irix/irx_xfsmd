<info>
There are multiple vulnerabilities in the xfsmd service. Due to weak RPC authentication scheme
remote calls of potentially dangerous RPC functions provided by xfsmd service can be performed.
The other problem with xfsmd is in the way it uses the libc popen() function call. When appropriately 
exploited any of these vulnerabilities can lead to the remote root access on a vulnerable system.
